## About TruthTable

TruthTable is a **desktop application** that enables team leaders to **manage their software
engineering teams** in one application.

TruthTable is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, TruthTable can get your task management done _blazingly fast_, faster than traditional GUI
applications.

## Using this guide

If you are a software engineering team leader looking to get started with TruthTable, make sure the [pre-requisites 
are installed](#getting-started).

[//]: # (TODO: link to team migration/onboarding section and features)
This document can also guide you on how to migrate your existing project information onto TruthTable, and 
familiarise you with all of TruthTable's features. 

If you are an experienced user of TruthTable, this guide also contains valuable tips on how you can maximise your 
productivity while using TruthTable.

Here are the symbols and text styles to look out for while using this guide:

## Key Features of TruthTable

### Too many cooks spoil the Truth

Managing project documents and information has always been an annoying task to do. Besides the multitude of 
links and slides created by the team, you may be using task management applications to track your team's 
progress as well. This is where TruthTable comes in. 

TruthTable allows you to **collate and organise all your tasks**, links, and member information all in one spot.

### Seeing is believing

It is often difficult to visualise and communicate your team's progress to stakeholders. TruthTable solves this 
through its ergonomic user interface. 

At a glance, you can see the number of tasks completed by your team, and **determine the team's overall progress**. 

TruthTable allows you to see which members are assigned to the tasks, enabling you to **delegate work in a fair and 
equitable manner**. 

### Built for convenience and speed

Context switching is a productivity killer. Having to switch from project management to product development usually 
means switching from GUI-based applications to CLI code editors. 

Hence, TruthTable allows you to use a **CLI for all your project management needs**, reducing the impact of context 
switching.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. If not, don't worry! Click
   [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) for further instructions on 
   how to download and install Java `11`.

2. Download the latest `truthtable.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TruthTable.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. A window which looks similar to the screenshot below should appear in a few 
   seconds. We've added some sample data for you to play around with and get familiar with the commands!<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window, which contains a link to this document.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:
   - `add member 1`
   - `add task "My First Task"`

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Important notes on how to use the commands:**<br>

- Quotes are optional for words (i.e. `add member "word"` and `add member word` are equivalent) when there is
  to be passed into commands.
  - However, if you want an argument to use multiple words, they should be surrounded with quotation marks.
  - Otherwise, they will be treated as 2 separate words.
  - For instance, `add member "two words"` indicates that you are
    adding the member named `two words`. 
  - However, `add member two words` is adding the member named `two` with some
    other argument `word`.
- Arguments are separated with "flags" (`add member "word" --email="sample@email.com"`)
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">**For experienced command line users**

You will find that the syntax is very similar to other command line interfaces like `git` and `docker`!
