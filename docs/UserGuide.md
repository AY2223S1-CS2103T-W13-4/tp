## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Quotes are optional for words (i.e. `add member "word"` and `add member word` are equivalent) when there is
  to be passed into commands.
  - However, for words containing spaces, they should be surrounded with quotation marks.
    Otherwise, they will be treated as 2 separate words (i.e. `add member "two words"` indicates that you are
    adding the member named `two words`, however, `add member two words` is adding the member named `two` with some
    other argument `word`)
- Double <kbd>Tab</kbd> to autocomplete string values (Coming soon!)
- Arguments are delimited with flags (`add member "word" --email="sample@email.com"`)
