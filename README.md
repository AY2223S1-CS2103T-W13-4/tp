## Overview

Are you

- a university student leading software engineering teams in your modules?
- having trouble keeping track of your team’s progress and delegating tasks effectively?
- someone who prefers CLI to GUI?
- desperate for a single source of truth on who’s doing what and by when?

Then, **TruthTable** is _perfect_ for you.

## Features

**TruthTable** allows you to

1. collate different project-related information (e.g. GitHub project PRs, issues, links to Zoom meetings, and Google
   Docs)
2. visualise your teams’ progress easily
3. delegate tasks to your team members conveniently
4. use CLI interface to manage your project tasks _blazingly_ fast.
